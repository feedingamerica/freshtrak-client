This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## First Steps

Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

In root folder run

### `yarn` or  `npm i`

to get the dependencies.

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


## Navigating

Click on create an account to see the current registration form.

Click on Sign in at the top to see the sign in form. Filling out the form and clicking `Log In` will sign you in. 

Sign in is currently takes any email or password. It just does some front end styling.

Right now there is no button to take you to the user edit page so you will have to manually change the url to http://localhost:3000/family/edit
