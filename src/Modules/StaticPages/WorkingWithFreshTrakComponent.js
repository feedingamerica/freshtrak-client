                                <p>With FreshTrak, we’re looking to leverage our experience to create a tool that feeds families faster, more securely, with solutions that fit their unique challenges. This new tool is designed for food banks to do the work that we do, while leveraging our collective power to help get meals where they are needed the most.</p>

                                <p>When you register with FreshTrak, you’ll get access to reporting that helps you know where to distribute your food, what sort of resources to provide your community, and reduce wait times at your events by pre-registering recipients ahead of time.</p>
